# Types and Class

Besides a types and classes example, this example also shows how a solution can use multiple files.

## Running

To run this code we need to reference all of the necessary files.  From within the directory you may do one of the following:

```bash
go run types-classes.go doggy.go
go run .
```

Or from the parent directory: `go run types-classes/*.go`
